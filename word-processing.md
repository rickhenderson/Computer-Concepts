##Paragraphs in Word

##Exploring Tabs and Indents

	While both very similar at first glance, both tabs and indents are ways of formatting paragraphs or lines of text to get the exact look or format you need for your document.
		
	Tabs are added to a document using the tab key. The tab is actually a key in the ASCII/ANSI character set, so when you save a document in other formats such as text files, the tab characters are retained. Typically a tab is inserted at the begining of some paragraphs so that the first line of the paragraph is moved in slightly from the left margin while the rest of the paragraph is flush with the margin. As you can see, the paragraphs in this section each have the first line tabbed in from the left margin by 1 tab stop. A tab stop is a position across the width of your document (often seen on the ruler of the word processor app) where the insertion point or cursor stops when the tab key is pressed. By default, the cursor will move 0.5 inches every time the TAB key is pressed on the keyboard, but this setting can be changed.

	Have you ever taken a typing course or English course where they told you that your paragraphs need to start 5 spaces in from the margin? That's because 5 spaces is the equivalent of a tab. The standard measurement for a tab is 0.5 inches, or 1.125 cm.
