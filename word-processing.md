##Paragraphs in Word
Nothing here so far.

##Exploring Tabs and Indents

While both very similar at first glance, both tabs and indents are ways of formatting paragraphs or lines of text to get 
the exact look or format you need for your document.

Tabs are added to a document using the tab key. The tab is actually a key in the ASCII/ANSI character set, so when you 
save a document in other formats such as text files, the tab characters are retained. Typically a tab is inserted at the 
begining of some paragraphs so that the first line of the paragraph is moved in slightly from the left margin while the rest 
of the paragraph is flush with the margin. As you can see, the paragraphs in this section each have the first line tabbed 
in from the left margin by 1 tab stop _[ed. not possible in Git Markdown]_. A tab stop is a position across the width of your document (often seen on the ruler 
of the word processor app) where the insertion point or cursor stops when the tab key is pressed. By default, the cursor 
will move 0.5 inches every time the TAB key is pressed on the keyboard, but this setting can be changed.

Have you ever taken a typing course or English course where they told you that your paragraphs need to start 5 spaces 
in from the margin? That's because 5 spaces is the equivalent of a tab. The standard measurement for a tab is 0.5 inches, 
or 1.125 cm.

In Microsoft Word, there are two ways to add tab stops (or simply referred to as tabs) at specific positions. The simplest way is 
to use horizontal ruler usually displayed  at the top of the screen. If you cannot see the ruler, click the __View__ tab and 
chose __Ruler__. To place a tab stop at the 3 inch mark  (that is, 3 inches in from the left margin) you can click on the ruler
just below the number 3. It might be tricky to start with, but it is easy once you get used to it. 

Clicking to place a tab on the ruler will place a small, black 'L' shaped symbol. It is a left tab stop symbol, meaning you have
placed a left tab. There are 6 types of tabs available in Word:

* Left
* Right
* Center
* Bar
* Decimal

It is possible to place every type of tab on the ruler by clicking, but a better option would be to use the Tabs dialog box for 
full control over all the tab settings.

_CAVEAT_
There is also one thing worth noting about Word. The first time you press the Tab key, Word will Auto-correct the tab character
into a left indent. This may not be what you want. A small tool appears with a lightning bolt on it indicating that an 
auto-correct has happened. Click it to select from the following items:
